Spotify weather playlist

## Project Title
Spotify Weather Playlist Generator

## Overview
The Spotify Weather Playlist Generator combines Spotify listening history with real-time weather data to create personalized playlists based on current weather conditions. By analyzing the weather at the time songs were played, the project categorizes tracks according to weather types (e.g., sunny, rainy) and generates playlists suited to today's weather.

The goal is to explore how weather influences music preferences and automate playlist creation tailored to the current mood of the day. This project involves data extraction, analysis, and building a recommendation system using weather and music data.

## Dataset
Source 1: Spotify listening history data (extracted from your Spotify account).
Includes timestamps, track names, artist names, and other metadata.

Source 2: Weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack).
Provides current weather conditions (temperature, weather type, time of day) based on location and time.

## Project Idea
The goal of this project is to combine personal Spotify listening history with real-time weather data to:

1. **Categorize songs based on weather conditions during specific listening times**
1. **Create customized playlists tailored to current weather conditions.**
1. **Provide insights into listening habits and their correlation with weather.**

The system will analyze the weather conditions when songs were played and suggest playlists that align with today’s weather. For example:
   - On a sunny day, generate an upbeat playlist.
   - For rainy weather, suggest a mellow, reflective playlist.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Extraction**
  - Use Spotify's data export feature to download listening history.
  - Set up and connect to a weather API to fetch historical weather data corresponding to timestamps.
  
2. **Data Processing**
  - Match each song’s timestamp to the relevant weather condition.
  - Categorize songs into weather-based clusters (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.).
  
3. **Modeling**
  - Use weather and time data to build a recommendation system that suggests playlists for the current weather.
     
4. **Output**
  - Generate a playlist automatically based on the user’s current location and weather.
    
5. **Ongoing Updates**
  - Update and refine the playlist creation rules based on feedback and performance.
    
## Features
 This project will include the following features:

- **Automatic Playlist Creation:** Based on current weather conditions (temperature, weather type, etc.), the system will automatically generate a playlist that fits the mood of the day (e.g., upbeat music for sunny weather, relaxing tunes for rainy days).
  
- **Mood-Based Categorization:** Songs will be categorized by their mood, tempo, and energy level to match weather conditions more accurately.

- **Weather-Based Playlist Suggestions:** Playlists will be dynamically adjusted based on the time of day and current weather conditions, offering users a tailored music experience.
  
- **Visualization:** Visualize trends in how music preferences change with weather conditions through interactive charts.
  
- **Historical Analysis:** Analyze past listening habits to see how weather has influenced song choices over time.
